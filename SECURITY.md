# Security Policy

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

As of the time of this writing, vulnerabilities are treated like bugs and fixed as quickly as possible. Please open an issue and make sure to include relevant information: Why is this a security issue? Is there a safe workaround? Do you know a way to fix it?

Pull requests are also welcome. I will review them and merge them into the main branch if they pass the requirements and are considered safe.

If you use Z3S5 Lisp for real-world applications where security is relevant, please open a discussion to let me know about it. Right now, there does not seem any need for that but I'm willing to change the security policy and accept private security / bug reports if it is important for you that they are not disclosed openly.
