# Z3S5 Lisp User Manual

for version 2.3

## Introduction

Z3S5 Lisp can be used as a standalone interpreter or as an extension language embedded into Go programs. It is a traditional Lisp-1 dialect, where the suffix 1 means that symbols hold one value and this value might either represent functions and closures or data. This is in contrast to Lisp-2 language like CommonLisp in which symbols may hold functions in a separate slot. Scheme dialects are also Lisp-1 and Z3S5 Lisp shares many similarities with Scheme while also having features of traditional Lisp systems.

### Invoking the Interpreter

In the directory `cmd/z3` there is an example standalone version `z3.go` that you can build on your system using `go build z3.go`. The interpreter is started in a terminal using `./z3`.

The `z3` interpreter is fairly limited. It starts a read-eval-reply loop until it is quit with the command `(exit [n])` where the optional number `n` is an integer for the Unix return code of the program.
